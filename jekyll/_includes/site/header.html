<p>Either start a new job posting or build from an existing template. As you edit, the text will be analyzed for grade reading level and problamatic phrases that might deter job seekers from applying.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Keep the reading level at or below the required education for the position so that it is more inclusive.</span><br>For example, if the job does not require a college degree then the reading level should not be above 12th grade. Remember, the average adultâ€™s reading level is 7th/8th grade.</p>
