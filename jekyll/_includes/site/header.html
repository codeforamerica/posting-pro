<p>Either start a new job posting or build from an existing template. As you type, the text will be analyzed for grade reading level and problematic phrases that might deter the right job seeker from applying. If the level is too high, the reading level indicator will be underlined in red.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Keep the reading level at or below the required education for the position so that it is more inclusive.</span><br>For example, if the job does not require a college degree then the reading level should be below 12th grade. Remember, the average adult is most comfortable reading at a 7th to 8th grade level.</p>
