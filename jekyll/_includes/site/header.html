<p>Either start a new job posting or build from an existing template. As you edit, the text will be analyzed for grade reading level and gender bias.</p>
<p><strong>Keep the reading level at or below the required education for the position so that it is more inclusive.</strong> For example, if the job does not require a college degree then the reading level should not be above 12th grade. Remember, the average adultâ€™s reading level is 7th/8th grade.</p>
